## Functions

### <a name="clinical-context"></a>clinical-context

(concept: String, sentence: String) &rarr; <String>

Determines the context of a concept within a sentence. The returned vector contains the following elements in order:

1. concept
2. sentence
3. negation context ("affirmed", "negated", "possible")
4. temporality context ("recent", "hypothetical", "historical")
5. experiencer context ("patient", "other")

#### Examples

```
clinical-context("pneumonia", "The patient denied a history of pneumonia.") =
< "pneumonia",
  "The patient denied a history of pneumonia.",
  "negated",
  "historical",
  "patient"
>
```

#### Implementation

This is implemented internally using [Lingua::Context](http://search.cpan.org/~osler/Lingua-ConText/lib/Lingua/ConText.pm).

### <a name="classify-text-language"></a>classify-text-language

(text: String, languages -> <<en>>) &rarr; String

Classifies the text as one of the listed languages. Returns the most likely language.

#### Implementation

This is implemented internally using [Lingua::YALI](http://search.cpan.org/~majlis/Lingua-YALI/lib/Lingua/YALI.pm).

### <a name="sentences"></a>sentences

(text: String) &rarr; <String>

Splits a text into a vector of sentences. Uses a list of common abbreviations for the text's language to avoid breaks in the middle of sentences.

#### Examples

```
sentences("The big black bug bit the big black bear. Suzy sold seashells by the sea shore. The lazy dog jumped over the crazy cow.") =
< "The big black bug bit the big black bear.",
  "Suzy sold seashells by the sea shore.",
  "The lazy dog jumped over the crazy cow."

A vector of languages recognized by the language classifier.

#### Implementation

This is implemented internally.

### <a name="stop-word-languages"></a>stop-word-languages
