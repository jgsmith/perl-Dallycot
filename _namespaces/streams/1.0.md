The definitions provided by this library operate on streams and/or produce new streams. This library also contains a number of streams representing special sequences.

## Functions

### <a name="downfrom"></a>downfrom

(x: Numeric) &rarr; [Numeric]

Produces a stream of numbers starting with the given number down through zero.

#### Examples

```
downfrom(5) = [ 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
downfrom(0) = [ 0 ]
downfrom(-1) = [ ]
downfrom(3.2) = [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ]
```

#### Implementation

```
y-combinator(
  (self, n) :> (
    (ceil(n) != n) : self(self, ceil(n))
    (n > 0) : [ n, self(self, n - 1) ]
    (n = 0) : [ 0 ]
    (     ) : [ ]
  )
)
```

### <a name="insert-after"></a>insert-after

(stream: [Any], value: Any) &rarr; [Any]

Returns a new stream with the given value inserted after the head of the given stream.

#### Implementation

```
(stream, value) :> [ stream', value, stream... ]
```

### <a name="last"></a>last

(s: [Any]) &rarr; Any

Returns the last value in a finite stream. This function will walk an infinite stream until it encounters some other limit such as running out of processing time.

#### Examples

```
last( mean( 1..10 ) ) = 55
last( max( [ 1, 3, 5, 3, 1 ] ) ) = 5
```

#### Implementation

```
y-combinator(
  (self, stream) :> (
    (?(stream...)) : self(self, stream...)
    (            ) : stream'
  )
)
```

### <a name="set-first"></a>set-first

(stream: [Any], stream-head: Any) &rarr; [Any]

Returns a new stream with the provided stream head replacing the head of the given stream.

#### Implementation

```
(stream, stream-head) :> stream-head ::> stream...
```

### <a name="set-rest"></a>set-rest

(stream: [Any], stream-tail: [Any]) &rarr; [Any]

Returns a new stream with the head of the first stream followed by the second stream.

#### Implementation

```
(stream, stream-tail) :> stream' ::> stream-tail
```
