## Functions

### <a name="N"></a>N

(x: Numeric, accuracy -> 40) :> String

Transforms a numeric value into a decimal representation with the number
of digits specified by the +accuracy+ option.

#### Examples

```
ns:math := "http://www.dallycot.net/ns/math/1.0#";
N(golden-ratio(), accuracy -> 5) = "1.6180"
N(pi()) = "3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197"
```


### <a name="string-drop"></a>string-drop

(s: String, count: Numeric) :> String

Returns a new string representing the content of the given string after removing
the initial number of characters indicated by the given count.

#### Examples

```
string-drop("The big bad bug bit the big black bear", 20) = "the big black bear"
string-drop("The big bad bug bit the big black bear", 1234) = ""
```

#### Implementation

This is implemented natively.

### <a name="string-join"></a>string-join

(joiner: String, s: [String]) :> [String]

Transforms a stream of strings into a stream containing the accumulation of
stream elements joined by the given string.

#### Examples

#### Implementation

This is implemented natively.

```
(joiner, stream) :>
foldl1({
  #1 ::> joiner ::> #2
}/2, stream)
```


### <a name="string-take"></a>string-take

(s: String, spec: Numeric|&lt;Numeric>|&lt;Numeric, Numeric>) :> String

Returns part of the given string based on the form and value of the specification.

- Numeric

  Returns the first part of the string up to the given length.

- &lt;Numeric>

  Returns the character at the given location as a string.

- &lt;Numeric, Numeric>

  Returns the sub-string starting at the location indicated by the first
  number for the length indicated by the second number.

#### Examples

```
string-take("The big bad bug bit the big black bear", 10) = "The big ba"
string-take("The big bad bug bit the big black bear", <5>) = "b"
string-take("The big bad bug bit the big black bear", <3,6>) = "e big "
