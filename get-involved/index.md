description: Information on how to contribute to the Dallycot project.
---

Dallycot is an open source project exploring the meaning and use of "Linked Open Code" as a companion to Linked Open Data. We are looking for contributions in any of the following areas.

## Write

Are you good at communicating technical topics to an audience with a wide range of experience and interests? Consider any of the following opportunities:

* documentation and tutorials for this website
* documentation about the internals of the Perl project
* blog posts about what "Linked Open Code" could enable in the digital humanities

## Test and Design

Not all testing involves writing and running code. We are also interested in hearing about possible use cases for "Linked Open Code" and situations in which a project like Dallycot might be useful.

## Code

If you find programming exciting and want to dive in, then consider any of the following opportunities:

* contribute libraries of functions to the Perl project
* build a "Linked Open Code" engine in your favorite language
* pick up some tasks on the [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1351864)[^1]

[^1]: You will need to be added to the project in Pivotal before you can claim tasks.
